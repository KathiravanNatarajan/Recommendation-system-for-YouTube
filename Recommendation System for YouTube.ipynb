Based on the above information, it becomes easy to recommend videos based on number of likes and views of the videos just by sorting.

Along with those users, I have also introduced the assumed like count of each video to that paticular user. This may seem to be little fuzzy. But it is like normal mapping of one user to the multiple videos in the dataset and each video will have the like or dislike option in the \"Liked\" column. If the value is 1, then that user liked that video. If the value is 0, then it can be considered as dislike or not watched that video.\n",
